Gilly Guilfoyle Photography is a site I made for my father. He showcase his photography to the world, so I saw it as an opportunity where we could help each other. It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices (images are designed to look their best on tablet/pc), making it easy to navigate for potential viewers.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are in this project are black and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Crimson Text font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Crimson Text stood out to me most while browsing google fonts, it is both attractive and appropriate. I used Cormorant Garamond for headings as it looked to me as if it was well suited with the main font.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is very important for this project, especially when viewed on a PC. The slider on the home page and gallery images are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes

-   Interactive elements

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on 4 pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home Page, Gallery Page, Contact Page and the 404 page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

- __The Landing Page Slider__

  - The landing includes a photograph slider to allow the user to see exactly what the website is about and who this site would be applicable to.
  - This section introduces the user to the photographer with 10 'featured images' to grab their attention.

- __Gallery Section__

  - The gallery section will allow the user to easily navigate through the work of the photographer and viewing the location ny simply hovering over the picture or tapping on mobile.

- __Contact Section__

  - This section will allow the user to get in contact with the photographer with any queries they may have.
  
  - __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes a mini navigation bar to the left for convenience. This also features a 'back to top' link which will bring the user to the top of the page without the unnecessary scrolling. In the middle I included information such as address, phone number and email address. And finally, on the right, I have links to the relevant social media sites for the photographer (placeholders). The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

  - __The 404 Section__
  - This page is to tell they user that they're in a place that doesn't exist and/or they clicked on a broken link. I styled it with the same colors I used for the rest of the site:

  ### Future Enhancements

- I would like to add a lightbox to the gallery imagess, so users can view a bigger version of the photos upon clicking.
- I would like to add a 'share' button to the gallery images, so users can share a photograph.
- I plan to update the featured images when the photographer comes back to me with better dimensions for mobile, these pictures are best viewed on tablet or PC currently.
